About
My interests involve supporting public servants and institutions in improving decision-making environments and organizational conditions to promote evidence-driven policy.

I earned a B.A. in economics and international relations from Connecticut College, where I completed a behavioral economics honors thesis and received the Chair’s Prize in Economics. I have applied behavioral science experience across academic and policy settings, including roles at Harvard Kennedy School, Duke University, and the MIT Sloan School of Management. I currently serve as the Behavioral Research Coordinator at Harvard Business School, and I support research that explores individual, group, and organizational decision-making. I have supplemented this professional research work with graduate-level courses in statistics, data, and public policy study at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and Harvard Extension School.

In 2025, I was selected as one of 29 participants in J-PAL North America’s Research Staff Training and as one of 20 participants in McGill’s Max Bell School of Public Policy Evaluation Capacity Case Challenge.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time exploring the outdoors and supporting community gardens and local organizations (See below).

About
My work focuses on strengthening how public institutions use evidence in practice. I am particularly interested in building local and state evaluation capacity and improving the systems, decision-making environments, and organizational conditions that shape whether evidence informs policy implementation. My goal is to support public servants and institutions in translating research into adaptive, effective, and representative public policy.

I earned a B.A. in economics and international relations from Connecticut College, where I completed a behavioral economics honors thesis and received the Chair’s Prize in Economics. My academic training reflects a broader interest in understanding how incentives, institutions, and human behavior interact in policymaking contexts.

I have applied behavioral science experience across academic and policy settings, including roles at Harvard Kennedy School, Duke University, and the MIT Sloan School of Management. I currently serve as the Behavioral Research Coordinator at Harvard Business School, where I support research at the intersection of decision-making, organizations, and applied policy relevance. My graduate-level coursework in statistics, economics, and public policy includes study at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and Harvard Extension School.

In 2025, I was selected as one of 29 participants in J-PAL North America’s Research Staff Training and as one of 20 participants in McGill’s Max Bell School of Public Policy Evaluation Capacity Case Challenge. These experiences further shaped my interest in evidence use, evaluation systems, and public-sector capacity building.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time exploring the outdoors and supporting community gardens and local organizations.
