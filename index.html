    <p>Thank you for your interest!</p>
    <p>I’m currently focused on other projects and coursework at the Harvard Extension School—specifically, Intermediate Statistics and Writing in the Social Sciences—so I haven’t had time to give this site the attention it deserves. I’ll return to it soon, but in the meantime, please feel free to reach out!</p>

    <p>A little about me and my interests: I chose to study economics and international relations in order to understand how the world works—and quickly discovered that traditional models often fall short. That realization drew me toward the behavioral foundations of both fields. I’ve become fascinated by how individual and group-level behaviors scale into complex, sometimes inefficient, outcomes.</p>

    <p>Today, I remain deeply curious about how interdisciplinary evidence and rigorous evaluation can improve both policies and the policymaking process itself. I’m especially interested in how we diagnose performance gaps, design reforms, and use behavioral insights to close the distance between intention and impact.</p>
